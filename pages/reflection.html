          Professional Development
        </h2>
        <p>
          During my professional career, especially through my background in
          banking, I discovered that I thrive in fast paced environments. I
          enjoy learning quickly, adapting to new challenges, and taking
          initiative when priorities shift. Over time, I’ve realized how much I
          value workplaces where growth and continuous learning are part of the
          culture. Now, as I transition into a tech role, I’m excited to apply
          that same mindset staying curious, picking up new tools and concepts
          quickly, and contributing to projects that make a real impact.

          Technical Development
        </h2>
        <p>
          As I continue growing in my technical journey, I’ve realized that many
          programming languages share similar concepts. I enjoy recognizing
          those connections and using them to understand new tools more quickly.
          It’s empowering to know that with the right logic and structure, I can
          use different languages to build the solutions I imagine. So far, I’ve
          learned HTML and CSS, developed projects using JavaScript, and begun
          working with Node.js. I’ve also used Sass for cleaner styling and am
          currently learning Tailwind CSS to build responsive, modern interfaces
          more efficiently.

          Personal Development
        </h2>
        <p>
          I’ve come to realize that I genuinely love learning and developing
          myself in new ways. Whether it’s improving my skills, strengthening my
          mindset, or gaining new perspectives, personal growth is something I
          truly value. Investing in myself has become a meaningful form of self
          care. It helps me stay grounded, motivated, and confident as I
          continue moving forward.
